I'm a PhD student in condensed matter physics, working with Prof. Yi-Ping Huang @ NTHU. My research interests include Tensor Network algorithms, Quantum Computing, Quantum States of Matter, Unsupervised learning.

I'm currently working on a novel phase of matter, called the many-body localization (MBL), with the use of Tensor Network methods. This dynamical phase is away from the equilibuim, with slow diffusion dehaviour. This provides a theoretical material for the quantum memory, and may also improve the coherent time for quantum computing.
